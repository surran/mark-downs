<h3 id="why-is-this-needed">Why is this needed?</h3>
<p>A good image adds value to your brand and draws visitors to your website.</p>
<p>When running a social media campaign,  you would need not one but many such images. Won’t it be great if there is a way to generate a custom image with the right content, aspect ratio and resolution in less than 30 seconds ?</p>
<h3 id="product-requirements">Product Requirements?</h3>
<p>A social media card look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://surran.github.io/mark-downs/assets/image-generator1.png" alt="" title="Wikipedia map"></p>
<p>The image has a text, a background image and website’s name. Let us reverse engineer these into requirements.</p>
<h4 id="image-resolution">Image Resolution</h4>
<ol>
<li>Both facebook share and twitter card images have 1.91:1 aspect ratio. This means that any image that has a different aspect ratio shall be cropped from either the top or sides.</li>
<li>Both facebook and twitter recommend images with or above 1200px width for optimum viewing experience on desktop and mobile.</li>
<li>All social media websites scale down high resolution images to optimum viewing resolution for speed and space.</li>
</ol>
<p>Considering these, an output resolution of 1200 x 630px works fine for us.</p>
<h4 id="background-imagecolorpattern">Background image/color/pattern</h4>
<p>An image could be a plain photograph, a photograph with an overlaying text, or text with solid color background.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<ol>
<li>A user should be able to set any image as background by specifying its url</li>
<li>A user should be able to  choose and specify a solid color as background.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="text">Text</h4>
<p>The  main text on the image needs to be concise and catchy. One can go with phrases with upto 5-6 words.</p>
<p>There should be provision to display the website’s name on the image for overall brand visibility.</p>
