<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>Sharing links to your website on facebook is a great way to draw visitors. But if your website is unprepared for this, the post on facebook may look quite unappealing, somwthing like:</p>
<p><img src="https://surran.github.io/mark-downs/assets/share-on-facebook2.png" alt="Share a file"></p>
<p>The facebook signature of your page creates the first perception. Let us work towards creating a good one!</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>The main ingredient this time is adding relevat meta tags on to you index.html file. Key steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>add facebook crawler readable meta tags</li>
<li>test on facebook developer tools</li>
<li>post on facebook to test live</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="add-open-graph-meta-tags">Add Open Graph meta tags</h4>
<p>Start with adding the image, title and description Open Graph meta tags to your index.html</p>
<pre><code> &lt;meta property="og:image" content="http://www.website1.com/image.jpg" /&gt;
 &lt;meta property="og:title" content="Page Title" /&gt;
 &lt;meta property="og:description" content="Short one line description of the page." /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>These would make sure that the image, title and description of your choice shows up when anybody shares a link to your page</p>
<p>For the image you can use any standard format (jpg, png, gif) but make sure the image resolution is 1200 x 630px. A resolution lower than this ends up in a blurred image on mobile web. A resolution with a different aspect ration is automatically cropped by facebook to fit this frame.</p>
<h4 id="test-on-facebook-developer-tools">Test on facebook developer tools</h4>
<p>Next head to the facebook sharing debugger on<br>
<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/sharing">https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/sharing</a></p>
<p>Enter your website url on this page and press Debug. The crawl results should look like</p>
<p>Here ‘Link Preview’ shows the post as it would look on facebook.  Play around with the meta tag contents till you get a ‘Link Preview’ of your satisfaction.</p>
<p>Here are some more things your can try:<br>
For pages where the description is more important than the image: Use an image with a taller aspect ratio (height more than width) so that facebook invokes the ‘small image &amp; large description’ post format.</p>
<p><img src="https://surran.github.io/mark-downs/assets/share-on-facebook.png" alt="Share a file"><br>
If the Open Graph image changes often then it is advisable to additionally have meta tags for image update time and image <em>alt</em> attribute</p>
<pre><code> &lt;meta property="og:updated_time" content="" /&gt;
 &lt;meta property="og:image:alt" content="Page Title" /&gt;
</code></pre>
<h4 id="test-live-on-facebook">Test live on facebook</h4>
<p>If everything seems fine then go ahead and post it on facebook. Before posting facebook would generate a preview of the post where you can once again check that the right text and elements are getting loaded.</p>
<p>The same text and elements would get loaded if anybody else posts a url from the website on facebook</p>
