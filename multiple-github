<p>I have two github accounts, one <em>github-work</em> and the other <em>github-personal</em>. While pushing/pulling code I often get a permission denied error. To resolve this I end up changing my git user credentials everytime, only to get the same error again in due course of time. What is the simplest way to make this seamless?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The permission issue comes because while pushing/pulling code from say a <em>github-work</em> repository, git might be using the <em>github-personal</em> private key or vice versa</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to fix this. I will share the one which I found the simplest and most seamless.</p>
<p>Browse to any of your local repository location and run the following command</p>
<pre><code>git config core.sshCommand "ssh -i ~/.ssh/[insert_your_keyname]'
</code></pre>
<p>If the local repository belongs to say <em>github-work</em> account, then make sure in place of <code>[insert_your_keyname]</code> you enter the private keyname generated from the same Github account.</p>
<p>Once you execute the above command, the <code>.git/config</code> file in your local repository will additionally have the below line under the <code>[core]</code> section</p>
<pre class=" language-con"><code class="prism  language-con">sshCommand = ssh -i ~/.ssh/[your_keyname]
</code></pre>
<p>Now onward all git commands (pull/push etc) from this local repository will use the specified private key</p>
<p>Repeat the same steps for other local repositories on your machine.</p>
