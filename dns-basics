<blockquote>
<p>DNS (Domain Name System) is a mapping between domain names and IP adresses.</p>
<p>Domain names (like <a href="http://terminalnotes.com">terminalnotes.com</a>) are what humans remember and type on their browser address bar. The internet network, on the other hand only understands IP addresses (like 66.249.82.197). DNS service is the bridge between the two. It takes a domain name as an input and returns the IP address that is associated with it as output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us discuss what happens when you type <a href="http://terminalnotes.com">terminalnotes.com</a> in the browser address bar and pressed enter.</p>
<p>The first thing that happens is your browser contacts a DNS resolver.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-dns-resolver">What is a DNS Resolver?</h3>
<p>A DNS resolver is a server specified by your internet service provider whose job is to return IP addresses for  domain names. It does so by contacting a  number of client services (called name servers) which help step-by-step locate the final IP address.</p>
<p><img src="https://surran.github.io/mark-downs/assets/dns-basics1.jpg" alt="DNS basic diagram"></p>
<p><em>How does a DNS Resolver know which name servers to contact for which domain?</em><br>
The answer to this is that domain owners specify their respective name servers at the time of domain registration.</p>
<p><em>How does a domain owner specify a name server</em>?<br>
Name servers IPs are typically provided (auto-generated) by the registrar, but as a domain owner you can also at any time choose to not use them and point to a different set of name servers.</p>
<p><em>What does a name server return?</em><br>
A name server either returns the final IP address (IP address of your website) or the IP address of another name server. In other words, name servers call each other serally (in a chain) until the final IP address is returned.</p>
<p><em>How does a domain owner specify the final IP address</em>?<br>
The final IP address gets specified when the domain owner creates a ‘Hosted Zone’ either at the Hosting provider or the Domain Registrar. Name servers get the information they need from hosted zones.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-hosted-zone">What is a Hosted Zone?</h3>
<p>A hosted zone lets the domain owner record information about how the domain name connects to its designated IP address. This specification is done by defining data attributes called <em>records</em>.</p>
<p>There are different types of records meant to serve different purposes. We will discuss the a few important ones:</p>
<h3 id="ns-record">NS Record</h3>
<p>NS (Name Server) record specifies the name servers that would use this Hosted Zone as a data source. Having a NS record is compulsory (it cannot be deleted or set to blank).</p>
<p>In a NS record, the IP values defined must match the name server IP values specified at the the Domain Registrar level (not doing so leads to a senario called <em>lame deligation</em>).</p>
<h3 id="a-record">A Record</h3>
<p>A (Address) record specifies the final IP address. This would be the public IP of your web hosting server (or the IP provided by your hosting service).</p>
<hr>
<p>Quite evidently, getting IP for domain name is a complicated serial process. For this reason mutiple layers of caching are introduced to make it efficient.<br>

<h4 id="caching-at-browser-and-os-level">Caching at browser and OS level</h4>
<p>Modern browsers cache DNS mappings right at the browser level. Apart form that, the Operating system is also capable of caching this data at the local machine level.</p>
<h4 id="caching-at-dns-resolvers-and-nameservers">Caching at DNS resolvers and Nameservers</h4>
<p>Both Domain resolvers ands name servers cache their output IP values.</p>
<p>All this caching introduces a parameter called TTL (Time To Live), which means the maximum amount of time it will take for the DNS configuration changes made by the website owner to reach the users.</p>
<p>NS Records typically have a TTL of 2 days. This means that it might take upto two days before DNS Resolvers start pointing to the new set nameservers.</p>
<p>A Records on the other hand typically have a short TTL of 5 minutes. This means name servers can switch from pointing to one final IP address to other in a matter of 5 minutes.</p>
